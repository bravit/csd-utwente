## Lecture 7

 1. Implementing exactLength, first attempt (via equality checking)
 2. Data type for checking equality at the type level and implementing exactLength
 3. Builtin type for checking equality
 4. Rotating vector revisited, rewriting types of holes
 5. Commutativity of plus
 6. Type Void and decidability
 7. Interface DecEq, reimplementing exactLength
